  [You may modify this data set (e.g. convert to csv) so that it is in a format that
   is appropriate for your algorithm]
-------------------

 - First column: instance number (can remove this column when feeling data to algorithm)
 - Second column: age of patient
 - Third column: spectacle prescription
 - Fourth column: astigmatic
 - Fifth column: tear production rate
 - Sixth column: CLASS label (see below as well as note about class)



    1. age of the patient: (1) young, (2) pre-presbyopic, (3) presbyopic
    2. spectacle prescription:  (1) myope, (2) hypermetrope
    3. astigmatic:     (1) no, (2) yes
    4. tear production rate:  (1) reduced, (2) normal


    -- 3 Classes
     1 : the patient should be fitted with hard contact lenses,
     2 : the patient should be fitted with soft contact lenses,
     3 : the patient should not be fitted with contact lenses.

   For the purposes of this homework question, you can turn this dataset into a
   binary classification problem by combining "fitted with hard contact lenses" and
   "fitted with soft contact lenses" (can call it "fitted with contact lenses"). 
   The other class can be "not to be fitted with contact lenses". For simplicity you
   can even call the classes "contact-lenses" and "no-contact-lenses"
   (To do: Convert the three-class problem into a binary classification problem as
   described above; then use the data set for the homework problem. Remembering to 
   ignore the first column as it is not necessary - just instance number.) 

   There will be 15 instances for "no-contact-lenses" and 8 instances for 
   "contact-lenses"

   - Relevant Information:
    The examples are complete and noise free.
    The examples highly simplified the problem. The attributes do not
    fully describe all the factors affecting the decision as to which type,
    if any, to fit.

   - Number of Instances: 24

   - Number of Attributes: 4 (all nominal)

   - Number of Missing Attribute Values:   0
